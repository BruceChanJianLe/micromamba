# micromamba üêç

This repository demonstrates usage of micromamba to manage your Python environment :D

## Installation

Use nix to install micromamba! Trust me it's much easier with nix.  

```bash
# Installing nix
ansible-pull -U https://github.com/brucechanjianle/ansible --ask-become-pass --tags nix
# Installing latest micromamba from nix store (for user)
nix-env -Ai nixpkgs.micromamba
```

## Create Environment

For example, you would like to create a new virtual environment
for you jupyterlab, you can run the following command:  

```bash
micromamba create -n jupyterlab jupyterlab -c conda-forge
```

You can also create the virtual environment first without installing
anything dependencies.  

```bash
micromamba create -n my_env
```

## Activate Environment

```bash
micromamba activate my_env
```

If you get the below warning, just follow the information to activate your environment.  

```
'micromamba' is running as a subprocess and can't modify the parent shell.
Thus you must initialize your shell before using activate and deactivate.

To initialize the current zsh shell, run:
    $ eval "$(micromamba shell hook --shell zsh)"
and then activate or deactivate with:
    $ micromamba activate
To automatically initialize all future (zsh) shells, run:
    $ micromamba shell init --shell zsh --root-prefix=~/micromamba
If your shell was already initialized, reinitialize your shell with:
    $ micromamba shell reinit --shell zsh
Otherwise, this may be an issue. In the meantime you can run commands. See:
    $ micromamba run --help

Supported shells are {bash, zsh, csh, xonsh, cmd.exe, powershell, fish}.
critical libmamba Shell not initialized
```

```bash
eval "$(micromamba shell hook --shell zsh)"
micromamba activate my_env
